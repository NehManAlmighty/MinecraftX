1. To compile and build the source code into a JAR file you firstly need to install gradle.
just search in google. gradle's website will provide gradle in a ZIP file.
extract it to C:\gradle. Then go to Control Panel\System and Security\System and click
Advanced system settings. Click environment variables.

2. Then under System Variables, click NEW...

in the variable name, enter GRADLE_HOME
in the variable value, enter C:\gradle

click OK


NOW LETS BUILD IT!!! :D

Open command prompt (admin rights usually not needed)

cd to the directory of the sources

type in "C:\gradle\bin\gradle build" without the quotes

now wait for the process to complete (may take 1-2 minutes, it took 50 seconds on my 1.65GHZ laptop.)

once it says "BUILD COMPLETE", then the JAR file will be located in build\libs\MinecraftX-x.x.jar where x.x is the version number (You can edit the version number by opening the build.gradle file and editing these lines:

version = "1.0"
group= "com.nehman.forge.minecraftx"
archivesBaseName = "MinecraftX"
